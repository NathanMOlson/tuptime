.SH DESCRIPTION
.RS
.RE
Tuptime is a tool for report the historical and statistical running time of 
the system, keeping it between restarts. Indeed, it can:
.RS
- Count system startups
.RS
.RE
- Register first boot time (a.k.a. installation time)
.RS
.RE
- Count nicely and accidentally shutdowns
.RS
.RE
- Uptime and downtime percentage since first boot time
.RS
.RE
- Accumulated system uptime, downtime and total
.RS
.RE
- Largest, shortest and average uptime and downtime
.RS
.RE
- Current uptime
.RS
.RE
- Print formatted table or list with most of the previous values
.RS
.RE
- Register used kernels
.RS
.RE
- Narrow reports since and/or until a given startup or timestamp
.RS
.RE
- Reports in csv

.RE
Average uptime:
.RE
Average downtime:
.RS
Time counter with the average time.

.RE
Current uptime:
.RS
